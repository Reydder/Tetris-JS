# Tetris with Javascript

I've made this project becasue of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNiyz0sl1no&t=296s.

After watching it only once I wanted to try it by myself and see hoy much time I spent to make it.
My mark has been: 5h 59m 50ms

I have to say that I'm not a javascript developer, i'm an iOS Developer but I've enjoyed the process of resolving problems in another language.
